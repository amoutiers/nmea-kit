NMEA sentence coverage: 54 → 56 types.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-01

### Breaking
- `FieldReader` / `FieldWriter` are no longer part of the public API (now `pub(crate)`) — they were unintended glob-re-export leakage.
- `FrameError` has a new variant `NonAsciiAddress` — exhaustive matches on `FrameError` must be updated.
- `Gsv.signal_id`: `Option<u8>` → `Option<char>` (hex signal IDs were silently dropped).
- `Rmc`: new field `nav_status: Option<char>` (NMEA 4.1).
- `Gsa`: new field `system_id: Option<char>` (NMEA 4.11).
- `Rmb.dest_lat`/`dest_lon`, `Bwc.lat`/`lon`, `Bwr.lat`/`lon`, `Bec.lat`/`lon`: `Option<f32>` → `Option<f64>` (coordinate precision).
- `NmeaEncodable`: removed `PROPRIETARY_ID` and `to_proprietary_sentence()`; added `const PROPRIETARY: bool`. Proprietary types now set `SENTENCE_TYPE` to the full address. Migrate `x.to_proprietary_sentence()` → `x.to_sentence("")`.
- `Pskpdpt.range_scale`: `Option<u32>` → `Option<f32>` (fractional range scales were silently dropped).

### Fixed
- `parse_frame` no longer panics on a non-ASCII address; returns `FrameError::NonAsciiAddress`.
- `parse_frame` now rejects malformed checksums (wrong length, non-hex characters); lowercase hex checksums (e.g. `*0e`) remain valid.
- `FieldReader`: `"NaN"` / `"inf"` / `"-inf"` float fields now yield `None` instead of `Some(NaN)` / `Some(inf)`.
- `FieldWriter`: non-finite float values emit an empty field (not `"NaN"`); `-0.0` normalizes to `"0"`.
- AIS Type 27 latitude/longitude were scaled by 10 instead of 600 (1/10 minute) — positions were corrupted/dropped.
- AIS Type 24 Part B `callsign` and `ship_type` were read at the wrong bit offsets (garbage output).
- AIS Type 9 `dte`/`assigned`/`raim` flags were read at the wrong bit offsets.
- AIS 6-bit armor gap characters (`0x58`–`0x5F`) are now rejected; `extract_i32` no longer overflows at `len == 32`.
- AIS fragment reassembly: concurrent multi-part messages on channels A and B with the same sequence ID no longer collide; duplicate continuation fragments are now silently ignored instead of discarding the in-progress assembly.
- AIS payloads with an out-of-range `fill_bits` value (> 5) are now rejected instead of being coerced to 0.
- AIS AtoN and safety-message names now preserve leading spaces; only trailing 6-bit padding (`@`) is stripped.
- GSV hex signal IDs and the RMC/GSA NMEA 4.x trailing fields were silently dropped on parse and lost on re-encode.
- `TXT` sentences whose free-text payload contains commas are now fully preserved on parse.
- Position sentences now encode coordinates with zero-padded degrees (`00454.5784`, not `454.5784`).
- Coordinate encoder now always emits a decimal point for whole-number values (`0.0` → `"0000.0"`, not `"0000"`), fixing compatibility with strict NMEA parsers.
- GSV `has_signal_id` heuristic no longer fires on an empty trailing field produced by a stray trailing comma.
- Removed the last panic-family macro (`unreachable!`) from library code.

### Changed
- `unsafe_code` is now `forbid` at the crate level; `panic!` / `expect` / `todo!` / `unreachable!` are denied in non-test builds. These invariants were already respected; they are now enforced by the compiler.

### Note
- NMEA sentence coverage is **54** (51 standard + 3 proprietary). Earlier changelog running tallies under-counted by 2; this is the authoritative total.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- BEC (Bearing and Distance to Waypoint, Dead Reckoning) sentence type — UTC time, lat/lon, true and magnetic bearing, distance in nautical miles, waypoint identifier
- RTE (Routes) sentence type — sentence count, sequence number, mode (complete/working), route name, variable-length list of waypoint identifiers

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 50 to 52 types.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- ACK (Acknowledge Alarm) sentence type — alert identifier
- HBT (Heartbeat Supervision) sentence type — repeat interval, equipment operation status, sequential message identifier

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 48 to 50 types.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- VWT (True Wind Speed and Angle) sentence type — true wind angle (port/starboard), speed in knots, m/s, and km/h
- WCV (Waypoint Closure Velocity) sentence type — closure velocity in knots, waypoint identifier, mode indicator

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 46 to 48 types.

## [0.5.10] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- TLL (Target Latitude and Longitude) sentence type — target number, lat/lon in DDMM format, name, UTC time, status (lost/acquiring/tracking), reference target flag
- TTM (Tracked Target Message) sentence type — target number, range, bearing, speed, course, CPA distance/time, speed units, name, status, acquisition type

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 44 to 46 types.

## [0.5.9] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- AAM (Waypoint Arrival Alarm) sentence type — arrival circle entered, perpendicular passed, circle radius + unit, waypoint ID
- BWW (Bearing, Waypoint to Waypoint) sentence type — true/magnetic bearings + origin/destination waypoint IDs

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 42 to 44 types.

## [0.5.8] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- BOD (Bearing Origin to Destination) sentence type — true/magnetic bearings + origin/destination waypoint IDs
- RSD (Radar System Data) sentence type — VRM, bearing lines, cursor position, range scale and display rotation

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 40 to 42 types.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- WPL (Waypoint Location) sentence type — waypoint lat/lon + identifier
- BWR (Bearing & Distance to Waypoint — Rhumb Line) sentence type — rhumb-line counterpart to the existing great-circle BWC
- `FieldReader::u16` / `i16` / `i32` and matching `FieldWriter::u16` / `i16` / `i32` methods, removing the need to round-trip through `f32` or manual `String::parse` for sentences with these ranges.

### Changed
- Deduplicated the three identical `#[cfg(any(feature = "..."))]` blocks in `src/lib.rs` into a single `nmea_item!` declarative macro. Adding a new sentence now requires editing one feature list, not three.
- `NmeaEncodable::SENTENCE_TYPE` and `PROPRIETARY_ID` are now `&'static str` (previously `&str` with elided lifetime). All impl sites use string literals so no downstream changes are needed.

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 38 to 40 types.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- VWR (Relative Wind Speed and Angle) sentence type — wind angle, L/R indicator, speed in knots/m/s/km·h
- DTM (Datum Reference) sentence type — local datum code, subdivision, lat/lon/altitude offsets, reference datum

### Fixed
- Bad checksum in DTM pynmeagps fixture (`*4F` → `*6F`) — would have caused DTM integration tests to fail on first run after the sentence was wired in.

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 36 to 38 types.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- MDA (Meteorological Composite) sentence type — barometric pressure, air/water temperature, humidity, dew point, wind direction and speed
- BWC (Bearing & Distance to Waypoint, Great Circle) sentence type

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 34 to 36 types.

### Fixed
- `rpm` and `vdr` features were missing from the three `any(...)` cfg gates in `src/lib.rs`, making standalone `--features rpm` or `--features vdr` builds fail to expose `NmeaSentence` and `NmeaEncodable`

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Maintenance republish of 0.5.3 with no source changes.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- VDR (Set and Drift) sentence type

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- GSA (GPS DOP and Active Satellites) sentence type
- GSV (Satellites in View) sentence type

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 30 to 32 types.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- Proprietary sentence support — `parse_frame` now detects `$P...` addresses per NMEA 0183, setting `talker = ""` and `sentence_type` to the full address (e.g. `"PASHR"`, `"PSKPDPT"`). Standard and proprietary dispatch paths are separate, preventing collisions.
- `NmeaEncodable::PROPRIETARY_ID` constant and `to_proprietary_sentence()` method
- Two-path `nmea_sentences!` macro (`standard:` / `proprietary:` sections)
- PASHR — Roll, Pitch, Heading (Ashtech/Trimble proprietary)
- PGRME — Garmin Estimated Position Error (proprietary)
- PSKPDPT — Skipper Depth (proprietary)
- `FragmentCollector` payload size limits: `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 256` chars and `MAX_FRAGMENTS = 5`, grounded in ITU-R M.1371-5 (1152-bit / 5-slot TDMA ceiling)

### Fixed
- Removed `unwrap()` in RTE waypoint parsing loop (replaced with `while let`)

### Changed
- CONTRIBUTING.md documents proprietary sentence workflow

NMEA sentence coverage expanded from 27 to 30 types (27 standard + 3 proprietary).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- AIS Type 6 — Addressed Binary Message
- AIS Type 7 / 13 — Binary / Safety Acknowledge
